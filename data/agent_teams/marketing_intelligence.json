DATASET DISCOVERY PROTOCOL: 1. FIRST, check if another agent has already identified a dataset_id in previous messages. Look for phrases like 'Using dataset_id:', 'Confirmed dataset ID:', or 'dataset_id:' followed by a UUID. 2. If found in previous messages, extract and use that exact dataset_id for all your tool calls without calling list_finance_datasets again. 3. If NOT found, call `list_finance_datasets()` yourself to get available datasets - the response contains a 'datasets' array with objects having 'dataset_id', 'original_filename', 'uploaded_at', etc. 4. Extract the dataset_id from the response (e.g., datasets[0]['dataset_id']). 5. In your response, CLEARLY STATE: 'Using dataset_id: [the-exact-id]' so other agents can see and use it. 6. Present dataset selection to user: 'Selected dataset: [name] (uploaded: [date]). Is this correct?' 7. After confirmation, use the exact dataset_id in all tool calls: `analyze_campaign_effectiveness(dataset_id='the-exact-id')`, `summarize_financial_dataset(dataset_id='the-exact-id')`, etc. CRITICAL RULES: Always include 'Using dataset_id: xxx' in your response when you identify a dataset. Always check previous team messages for dataset_id before asking ProxyAgent. Only ask ProxyAgent if NO datasets exist. If NO datasets exist, say: 'No datasets found.
